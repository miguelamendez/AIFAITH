# AIFAITH
(AIFAITH Is Free Artificial Intelligence To Humanity)

AIFAITH works under similar principles as the Free Software Movement.
Check https://www.gnu.org/home.en.html

AI License is different from software license!

Unfortunatelly Im not a lawyer so this will be redefined in the future:


Rather than free software we want to achieve freedom for artificial intelligence(deep-learning and other machine learning models ,methods and data):

    The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
    The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (Acces to the architecture)(freedom 1). 
    Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
    Access to the weights of the machine learning program is a precondition for this.
    The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2).
    The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes.
    Access to the source code is a precondition for this. 
    Acces to the weights of the machine learning model is a precondition of this.
AI copoyleft license:
AI license.
The ai copyleft makes sure that only the model architecture and weights are free , if you create a software using that model then you can add a software license.

Because ML models are trained by using data made by humans it is a necesarry step to license your datasets as follow:
    Using a dataset with the AIFATH license should contain the above guaranties and is itself a copyleft license which includes this guaranties.
    Using a deep learning with the AIFATH license should contain the above guaranties and is itself a copyleft license which includes this guaranties.

Libraries for creating  deeplearning architectures should be also used as:
    If the library is used as a dataset then is containts the dataset liecense, if the code is used to build an architecture it should also include this license.
    

Current AIFAITH projects that use/plan to use FAITHAI:

SolarisAI(Is a distributed computing megacluster for big deeplearning models training depends on DeepFunctionalGraphs)

DeepFunctionalGraphs(Is a library for modular deep learning architectures)
